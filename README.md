TODO:

* keep output of tests
* reduce the number of times we run functests to a minimum
* actual functests - very basic, check Nagios is green, check data is in Graylog, etc. rather than the functests we run for the individual charms
* cut down the side effect if some charms go wrong -> basic unit crashes -> affect the charms to test later
